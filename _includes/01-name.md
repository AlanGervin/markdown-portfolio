# Alan Gervin
### Full Stack Developer

Greetings! My name is Alan Gervin and I'm a full stack developer. I recently completed my web developer course on codecademy. I learned a bunch of new technology like
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Express
- Git
- SQLITE
- MongoDB 

I also learned the following JavaScript modules:
- handlebars
- jekyll
- Mongoose
- Mocha
- Chai
- SQLITE3.

In my course I learned how to write a full CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) API's from scratch using the Express server and using Test Driven Development from the outside in to develop maintainable, complete, fast, isolated, reliable, expressive tests that would give anyone confidence that the system is working correctly using feature tests, server tests, and unit test.

I am actively seeking employment. If you have an idea and would to see it brought to life please contact me.

If you would like to know more please contact me via email at <alan.gervin@gmail.com>
