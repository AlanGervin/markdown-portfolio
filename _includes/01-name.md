# Alan Gervin
### Full Stack Developer

Greetins! My name is Alan Gervin and I'm a full stack developer. I recently completed my web developer course on codecademy. I learned a bunch of new technology like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Express, Git, SQLITE, and MongoDB as well as some JavaScript modules 
like handlebars, jekyll, Mongoose, Mocha, Chai and SQLITE3.  In my course I learned how to write a full CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) API from scratch using the Express server and using Test Driven Development from the outside in to develop maintainable, 
complete, fast, isolated, reliable, expressive tests that would give anyone confidence that the system is working correctly using feature tests, server tests, and unit test.
